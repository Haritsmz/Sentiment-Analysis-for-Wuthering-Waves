YangYang, my flippin&#39; god, the first time I heard her in this quest it was so &quot;UGHHHHH JUST END THIS ALREADY I&#39;D RATHER ALREADY STOP PLAYING THIS&quot; But I went through it. And this quest... piece of art Kuro, it&#39;s something you wanted to do in CBT1. Dark, and really intense, though I don&#39;t really like the entire &quot;lore drop&quot; that was so early implemented with the game of us being the creator of Jinzhou, and that was just dropped so... like the feeling without care, I don&#39;t know what it was when I heard that line from Ju√©, but it just felt really weird to drop something SO important so early into the games story, at least for me, dunno if it was for anyone else.<br>Also, I think we could&#39;ve kept Phrolova&#39;s name a secret for a BIT longer instead of revealing it without proper introduction (and when we do get the official introduction with her and rover it will be just... kind of akward) or maybe  it won&#39;t be and it will be executed next to flawlessly.<br>This story REALLY did a good job with animating expressions, I really like how lively everyone is in this story with the extra keyframes and just expressions as a whole. Facial animations don&#39;t lack either, and CUTSCENES. HOLY CRAP, CUTSCENES... they were just a work of art, like this one right here, how the fudge did you ACTUALLY do something no other gacha game has done till this time? MAKE A CUTSCENE LONGER THAN 2 MINUTES? THAT IS CRAZY. LIKE AN IN-GAME ONE. This cutscene in particular is so... how do I say it? It&#39;s ambient, you can feel the emotion and the stakes of overall everything Jinshi does, she feels like a human being that wants to do something for her people. To save them from damnation, and knows the consequences of what happens if she does fail. Rover doesn&#39;t really do anything in the fight just watches it from a far enough place. This was absolutely gorgeous, ALL Voice actors did good, maybe except Abby and ESPECIALLY YANGYANG. PLEASE, DO SOMETHING ABOUT YANGYANG, HER VOICE ACTOR FITS, BUT SHE IS JUST...

@ArchonOfDoom,"The 1.1 update was a HUGE step foward for Kuro Games. The EN voice acting was so much better, and the story was also improved. For me, the main improvement is the main character&#39;s weight on the story. In hoyoverse games, it is rare to see the main character interract vocally with others, this happened here for the entirety of the story. Huge props to Kuro Games for keeping the spirit of main character.<br>The new characters were immensely nice, the npc-s model worked fine, and the new enemy models are top notch as well.<br>The difficulty keep spiking up, wich should be the norm, and the exploration factor still has the grasp on the player, to urge them to keep playing.<br><br>Huge ups for Kuro games, however I would like to share an insight.<br>Spoiler alert:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>When I first met Jinshi in the story, in the version 1.1, a &quot;hoyoverse&quot; moment happened.<br>She was supposed to be bleeding, according to Changli, hurt and tired. She was on the Mt. for a while and is currently were fighting 3 Glacio Dreadmanes, at the same time, who she managed to one-shot with ease. (Keep in mind that Glacio Dreadmanes are no joke in the game, they hit hard and have a lot of health.)<br>This happened when she was &quot;supposed&quot; to be hurt and tired. This feeling were thrown out of the window right there.<br><br>Her character model/skin was clean like snow. Nothing happened that would make the player worry for her, she didn&#39;t pant, she didn&#39;t look exhausted, she wasn&#39;t hurt.<br>I don&#39;t want to see her in blood, nor yelping out, no. I&#39;m not saying that. I am saying that some little details should be added at times like theese. Dirt, dust!<br>This is what I would call a &quot;hoyoverse&quot; moment, where most of theese moments happen in the talk. Show, don&#39;t tell. You don&#39;t need to treasure girlies so much on screen, we are not snowflakes. The worry factor were thrown out of the window.<br><br>Remember 1.0? When the guy at the cannon died on screen infront of the main character? He was full of dirt and blood, and he told us that he bought enough time for the cannon, wich made the scene emotional. Being a random character instead a playeable one, this definetly was a HUGE step foward in gacha games history, in my opinion.<br><br>I am saying again, I didn&#39;t want to see Jinshi in blood. A little spec of dust on her cheeks, more of thoose &quot;scales&quot; should have been on her body, make her pant a little more, let the audience worry for her. (She is also pretty heavy waifu material, so showing her more vulnereable would fuel more emotion for the scene, in my opinion.)<br><br>Sorry for the wall of text, and well theese are just MY OPINION. It is totally possible that I am overreacting, I just see some hints that happened mostly in Genshin/hsr and it would ruin the immersion in my opinion. Mostly at least.<br>Overall the 1.1 update was a HUGE step foward, and I think It is one of the best updates, any gacha games had over the years.<br>Hats off Kuro Games, thanks for making theese improvements.<br>Also thanks for reading, cheers o/",update huge step foward kuro game en voice acting much better story also improved main improvement main character weight story hoyoverse game rare see main character interract vocally others happened entirety story huge prop kuro game keeping spirit main character new character immensely nice npc model worked fine new enemy model top notch well difficulty keep spiking wich norm exploration factor still grasp player urge keep playing huge ups kuro game however would like share insight spoiler alert first met jinshi story version hoyoverse moment happened supposed bleeding according changli hurt tired mt currently fighting glacio dreadmanes time managed one shot ease keep mind glacio dreadmanes joke game hit hard lot health happened supposed hurt tired feeling thrown window right character model skin clean like snow nothing happened would make player worry pant look exhausted hurt want see blood yelping saying saying little detail added time like theese dirt dust would call hoyoverse moment theese moment happen talk show tell need treasure girlies much screen snowflake worry factor thrown window remember guy cannon died screen infront main character full dirt blood told u bought enough time cannon wich made scene emotional random character instead playeable one definetly huge step foward gacha game history opinion saying want see jinshi blood little spec dust cheek thoose scale body make pant little let audience worry also pretty heavy waifu material showing vulnereable would fuel emotion scene opinion sorry wall text well theese opinion totally possible overreacting see hint happened mostly genshin hsr would ruin immersion opinion mostly least overall update huge step foward think one best update gacha game year hat kuro game thanks making theese improvement also thanks reading cheer,"{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.802, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9728}",0.074,0.124,0.802,0.9728,positive,2024-07-02T06:42:32Z

@qushieeri,"Please Kuro Game, I hope you fix all the issues and flaws in this game at its finest. I hope you do this game at its finest too. I hope you do this game with a lot of passion and listen to what the community says.<br><br>For example:<br>- Make the map artstyle cooler, the current one is not it. Make the NPC, mobs, animals &amp; etc feels more alive (For example in the Open World the mobs its fighting each other chilling with their homie or something, makes it more of it like there&#39;s puzzles games right, make them active the puzzles and react to it not just mobs all the others too like NPC animals and etc, make them knows the puzzles exist and not just we (The Players) knows the puzzles) also make the puzzles in this game more depth and have a lot of ways to complete it and not just one linear same straight line. Add more weather too and other cool stuff too.<br><br>-  I really like the first cutscene where we fought the Crownless for the first time. It has more dynamic to it, makes the players we are in real threats which results for players to feel excited to fight the boss. The game doesn&#39;t need to be so easy like the boss can be hard to for you to defeat it, don&#39;t nerf the boss or characters too much please, the game can stand on its own feets tbh they don&#39;t need to be for everyone, look at the Cuphead situation everyone&#39;s said the game is hard but they like them and some of them are not especially (The Journalist cuz they don&#39;t how to playing a game even in the most basic ways) but they make that because it&#39;s how they intended the game to be.<br><br>- I hope you can lower your Pity System for the Gacha System tbh and be more F2P like your game a bit PGR. Give us more currency to pull for the characters we want like you did in PGR. If we clear the contents there&#39;s a lot of significant currencies for us to pull and get the characters we want and take it as an example from Blue Archives they always give significant enough currencies to pull if we clear the contents. The Echo Systems please don&#39;t add too many unnecessary sub-stats, please make the sub-stats fewer and easier for us to get the sub-stats we want and higher the rate-up too. The Characters Ascension Materials, I hope you lower it because it&#39;s too much. The Co-Op System please the Co-Op not just farming for Echoes, make it more unique and variables like we can do story together, commission together &amp; fight bosses, clears contents like end-game contents together &amp; etc.<br><br>I have many things to say to y&#39;all but it&#39;s just too much, please check out this video. It&#39;s one of your PGR Content Creators who talks about your new upcoming game Wuthering Waves of it flaws and great things about it.

In general, all such gacha games are essentially not games at all, they are as empty as possible, with the prospect of decades to close a second-rate plot.

Such empty games really need tasty advertising. But I didn‚Äôt see anything tasty in the video for this game, or in the game itself as a whole. The current gaming community is degrading, and every new dummy is applauded. Everyone has already spent their time and money in Genshin, then in Star Rail, and now they want to spend it here. And every year another new Zelda-style dummy will be released, and as a result, people will play a dozen games, but in none of them will they see a completed story.
